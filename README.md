# About the Project
Emobot uses a Machine learning model for facial and emotion recognition. The model was trained using the AlexNet CNN with preprocessed grayscale images using Tensorflow and Keras. It was then deployed onto a webapp using Flask. The app is able to detect faces and predict emotions in realtime and display the emoji and text corresponding to the emotion.

# Data
The following dataset was used to train our model. It contains grayscale images of 7 different emotions.
